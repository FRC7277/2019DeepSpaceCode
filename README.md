# Commit Practices (For contributors)

This branch is for code for the 2019 FRC Compitition, which is seperate from any other FRC seasons, unofficial seasons (e.g. BetaBots), and other robots (e.g. party bots).

When updating code, if it is a small change it is fine to commit directly to  _2019_ branch, since git has version control and history, but for large rehauls, consider commiting to a seperate branch (e.g. _2019-test_ or something of the like) until the change has been tested and approved by the rest of the team.
